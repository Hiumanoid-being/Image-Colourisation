# 🎨 Image Colorization using Deep Learning

> *"Bringing black and white photos back to life with the power of AI."*

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project explores **automatic image colorization** — transforming grayscale images into realistic color images using **deep learning**.  
By training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict color channels from luminance information, this model learns how to color the world, one pixel at a time.

The model is trained end-to-end on colored image datasets, where:
- The **input** is the grayscale *L* channel from the LAB color space.
- The **output** is the color *a,b* channels predicted by the network.

Once trained, the model can colorize previously unseen black-and-white photographs — restoring vivid life to historical or artistic images.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Convert grayscale images to full-color using deep learning  
✅ CNN-based encoder–decoder architecture  
✅ Automatic preprocessing pipeline (RGB → LAB → (L, ab))  
✅ Easily extendable to GAN or VGG-based perceptual models  
✅ Realistic and visually appealing color outputs

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Preprocessing:**  
   Convert all RGB images into LAB color space, extract the L (lightness) channel as input and the a,b (color) channels as targets.

2. **Training:**  
   A CNN-based encoder–decoder model learns to predict a,b channels from the L input.

3. **Colorization:**  
   For unseen grayscale images, the model predicts the missing a,b channels and reconstructs a full-color image.
